## Dataset
I will be using the dataset on grade found at kaggle with a license of Public Domain Dedication
[original website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data)
This is an educational data set which is collected from learning management system (LMS) called Kalboard 360. Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent LMS, which has been designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. Such system provides users with a synchronous access to educational resources from any device with Internet connection.
## Cleaning dataset
The dataset is already pretty clean, it does not have any inconsistent or missing data. Moreover, the column headers is proper readable. So i think the dataset does not need to further modification.
